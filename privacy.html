      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Today's Date]<br>
      <strong>Extension Name:</strong> Shop2not<br>
      <strong>Developer:</strong> David Weinrot</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Shop2not is a Chrome extension that helps users extract product data from their Shopify admin dashboard and export it into a CSV format suitable for upload into Whatnot. This policy explains what data is (and isn't) collected, how it's used, and how it complies with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies.</p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p><strong>Shop2not does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).</strong> The extension functions entirely within the user's browser environment and does not send any data to external servers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect user names, email addresses, or payment information.</li>
        <li>We do not track browsing history.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or share any user data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
      <p>To provide its core functionality, Shop2not uses the following Chrome extension permissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab</strong> – Accesses the currently open Shopify product page to extract product information.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions</strong> (<code>https://admin.shopify.com/*</code>) – Required to read product details directly from Shopify's admin dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting</strong> – Injects a local script to read the DOM of the Shopify page.</li>
        <li><strong>storage</strong> – Stores user-defined settings and temporary session data locally.</li>
        <li><strong>downloads</strong> (if used) – Saves the extracted data as a CSV file on the user's computer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Handling and Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All data is processed <strong>locally</strong> in your browser.</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted, stored, or logged externally.</li>
        <li>Data is temporarily stored using Chrome's <code>storage.local</code> API and is only accessible to the extension.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Shop2not does <strong>not</strong> use third-party services, analytics tools, or remote code libraries. All code is bundled within the extension.</p>

      <h2>User Consent</h2>

      <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
